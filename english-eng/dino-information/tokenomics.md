# Tokenomics ðŸ“Š

The DINO tokenomics have been structured **fairly and transparently** so as to benefit the whole ecosystem equally. The bulk of the DINO tokens have been allocated towards farming operations in order to **maximize rewards for users**. The remaining tokens have been distributed between the token sale, burn, airdrop, treasury and the DINO team.&#x20;

The DINO ecosystem will incentivize all users to contribute by rewarding them as a measure of their contribution. **DINO is all about speed and performance**, so we have prioritized the functionality of earning and staking. All these and more can be achieved by HECOs superior speed and incredibly low transaction fees.

**Token Ticker - $Dino**

DINO token is the governance token of the DINO Defi platform. It will also capture the economic benefits of the protocol. There will be a maximum of **250,000,000** $Dino tokens.
