# The Treasury

The Treasury plays a very important role in Safuu's SAP protocol. It provides three extremely critical functions for the growth and sustainability of Safuu.&#x20;

The treasury functions as additional financial support for the SIF. This additional support can become important in the event of an extreme price drop of the $SAFUU token or unforeseen black-swan event. It helps to establish a floor value for the $SAFUU token.&#x20;

The treasury may also be used to fund new Safuu products, services, and projects that will expand and provide more value to the Safuu community aswell as providing funding for marketing. &#x20;
