# The Treasury

The Treasury plays a very important role in Dinuu's protocol. It provides three extremely critical functions for the growth and sustainability of Diuu.&#x20;

The treasury functions as additional financial support for the DIF. This additional support can become important in the event of an extreme price drop of the $DUU token or unforeseen black-swan event. It helps to establish a floor value for the $DUU token.&#x20;

The treasury may also be used to fund new Dinuu products, services, and projects that will expand and provide more value to the Dinuu community including, but not limited to, providing funding for marketing. &#x20;
