# Dinuu Insurance Fund (DIF)

DIF is the acronym for the Dinuu Insurance Fund which is a separate wallet in Dinuu's protocol. The DIF uses an algorithm that backs the Rebase Rewards and is supported by a portion of the buy and sell trading fees that accrue in the DIF wallet. &#x20;



In simple terms, the staking rewards (rebase rewards) which are distributed every 30 minutes are backed by the DIF parameter, thus ensuring a high and stable interest rate to $DINUU token holders.&#x20;

5% of all trading fees are stored in the Dinuu Insurance Fund which helps sustain and back the staking rewards provided by the positive rebase.

### DIF Keeps holders safe by:

* Avoiding flash crash through price stability
* Achieving longterm sustainability and future growth of the Dinuu Protocol
* Greatly reducing downside risk
