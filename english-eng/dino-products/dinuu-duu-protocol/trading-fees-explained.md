* **LP -** Trading fees goes to backing the liquidity of the BNB/SAFUU pair on PancakeSwap ensuring an ever-increasing collateral value of $DUU.
* **DIF -** Trading fees are stored in the Dinuu Insurance Fund which helps sustain and back the staking rewards provided by the positive rebase.
* **Treasury -** Trading fees go directly to the treasury which supports the SIF and provides a marketing budget for DINUU and funds new product development.
* **Fire Pit -** 2.5% of all $DUU traded are burnt in the Fire Pit. The more that is traded, the more get put into the fire causing the fire pit to grow in size, larger and larger through self fulfilling auto-compounding which in return acts to reduce the circulating supply of $DUU and keeping the Dinuu protocol stable.
