### Dinuu: <mark style="color:green;">D</mark>ecentralized <mark style="color:green;">I</mark>nvestment <mark style="color:green;">U</mark>nified <mark style="color:green;">U</mark>tility &#x20;

#### Dinuu is a decentralized financial platform. We reward long term holders and users with a fixed compound interest, which auto-rebases every 30 mins.&#x20;

The Dinuu platform is a new addition to our DinoDefi protocol. **As farming involves an extensive number of "button pushing," which can be tedious and dauting for new investors, we implemented the Dinuu platform as a means of providing a constant, steady stream of value for long term investors.** Simply hold the tokens in your wallet and the platform will take care of your compounds via auto-rebasing.&#x20;

The Dinuu platform gives the DUU token automatic staking and compounding features, and one of the highest Fixed APY in the market at <mark style="color:green;">**382,945.41%**</mark> for the first 12 months.

The Dinuu plaftorm provides incentives for long-term holders and creates a robust, safe platform via:

* <mark style="color:green;">**Low Risk through our Dinuu Insurance Fund (DIF)**</mark> - 5% of all trading fees are stored in the Dinuu Insurance Fund which helps sustain and back the staking rewards by maintaining price stability and greatly reducing downside risk.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Easy and Safe Staking**</mark>** -**  The Dinuu token always stays in your wallet so it doesn’t need to be put into the hands of a 3rd party or centralized authority. All you need to do is buy & hold as you automatically receive rewards in your own wallet so there’s no more complicated staking processes at all.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Interest Yield with Automatic Payments**</mark>** -** You need not be worry about having to re-stake your tokens. Interest yield is paid automatically and compounded in your own wallet, guaranteeing you will never miss a payment.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Highest Fixed APY**</mark>** -** Dinuu pays out at 382,945.41% in the first 12 months. After the first 12 months, the interest rate drops over a predefined Long-term Interest Cycle period.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Rapid Interest Payments**</mark>** -** The Dinuu Protocol pays every Dinuu Token holder each and every 30 minutes, making it one of the fastest auto-compounding protocol in crypto.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Auto Token Burn**</mark>** -** One of the exciting features of the Dinuu Protocol is an automatic token burn system named “The Fire Pit” which prevents circulating supply getting out of hand and becoming unmanageable. The Fire Pit burns 2.5% out of all Dinuu Token market sales and is burned in the same individual transaction.

The Dinuu Platform uses a complex set of factors to support its price and the rebase rewards. It includes the **Dinuu Insurance Fund (DIF)** which serves as an insurance fund to achieve price stability and long-Term sustainability of the Dinuu Protocol&#x20;

The Dinuu development team has coordinated all of these elements together so they work seamlessly behind the scenes. The result is a simple and elegant staking and rewards system for $DUU holders. &#x20;
