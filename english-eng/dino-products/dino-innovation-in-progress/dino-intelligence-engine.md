# DINO Intelligence Engine

The DINO Intelligence Engine is an **off-chain oracle that is sourcing intelligence** into the on-chain DeFi proxy smart contract. The engine is composed of **complex architecture and data pipelines** as well as **optimized databases** containing very large datasets.&#x20;

The DINO Engine then uses this data to **divide assets and investment opportunities** into **allocation baskets** sorted by the duration of exposure and risk level. The users will then be able to decide how much of their assets they will want to allocate to each asset.
