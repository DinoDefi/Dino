# DYT (In Progress)

DYT Pools: new tokens enter the DINO community!

DYT Pools allow Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to $Dino token holders. <mark style="color:red;">Jurassic Pool</mark> is split into two sections: Core and Community.

Core will be initially selected by the DINO team while Community will be selected via a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any projects will be able to distribute tokens via DYT Pool, but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option.
