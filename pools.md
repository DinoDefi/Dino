# xDINO Pools

xDINO Pools: new tokens enter the Dino DeFi community!

xDINO Pools allow Huobi ECO Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to $DINO token holders. Syrup Pool is split into two sections: Core and Community.

Core will be initially selected by the Dino team while Community will be selected via a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any projects will be able to distribute tokens via Syrup Pool, but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option (in order to discourage scams).
