#Dino Dao Governance

$DINO tokens will be used for staking as a representation of voting power, and for determining the distribution of staking fees. Dino will be governed through a DAO structure, with $DINO tokens representing voting power, which can be used directly or delegated. Possible governance proposals include: 

1. Changing asset structure (fees, composition, or creation)
2. Raising or lowering the reserve limit of a market; adjusting yield distribution and interest rates
3. Altering pool attributes, such as voting power time function, poolâ€™s dynamic interest % calculation for staking

These proposals will be voted on by any user that holds the voting threshold of $DINO tokens, and adopted or rejected in an autonomous and transparent fashion.
